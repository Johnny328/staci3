pressure dependent simulations: OK
segmentation:										OK
since demands are in litre/sec, massFlowRate -> volumeFlowRate 
then calculate alfa, beta etc.

*** 2019.08.03. ***
massFlowRate variables have been changed to volumeFlowRate, tested in hermes
test is required with Anytown, especially considering the pump!

*** 2019.08.05. ***
tested with hermes, Anytown, villasor etc., it matches with staci viewer
expectedShutdownEffect: topological and one-simulation quantities looks okay, checking required
also local Alfa should be downscaled to 0...1 range by diveding with sum inflow
multiple-simulations quantities are next to write

*** 2019.08.06. ***
TODO: getDoubleProperty() function should call getEdgeDoubleProperty function
TODO: alfa probably not right, nagycenk seems a proper network for testing

*** 2019.08.08. ***
alfa seems right, however major differences are compared to Tam√°s's results, need consultation (ese.cpp)
